## Git Commands
### Basic Commands

* ACP (**A**dd, **C**ommit, **P**ush)
* Deleting a branch

##### To delete a local branch:

This "-d" option will only delete if the branch has been pushed and merged with the remote branch.

>
    git branch -d <my-branch-name>


##### To delete a remote branch:

The "-D" branch will force the branch to delete, even without being pushed and merged yet.

>
    git branch -D <my-branch-name>

Go to the repo.  Click on the # branches.  Find the branch you'd like to delete and click on the red trash can to the right of it.  You are able to restore if needed.
